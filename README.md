📱 Mobile Phone Pricing Prediction
Predict the price range of mobile phones using machine learning! This project analyzes key mobile features to classify phones into four distinct price categories — from budget-friendly to premium flagships.

🚀 Project Overview
In today’s competitive smartphone market, pricing plays a crucial role in customer decision-making. This model leverages various phone specifications like battery capacity, camera quality, processor speed, RAM, and connectivity features to predict the price range of a mobile phone. Whether you’re a retailer, manufacturer, or consumer, this tool can help you understand how specs translate to pricing tiers.

🔍 Features & Dataset
The dataset consists of detailed mobile phone attributes, including:

Battery Power (mAh)

Bluetooth Availability

Processor Speed & Core Count

Camera Megapixels (Front & Primary)

Internal Memory (GB)

Screen Dimensions & Resolution

RAM (MB)

Connectivity (3G, 4G, WiFi)

Touch Screen Support
